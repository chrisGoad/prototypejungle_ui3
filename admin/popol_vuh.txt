This is the account of when all is still silent and placid. All is silent and
calm. Hushed and empty is the womb of the sky.


These, then, are the first words, the first speech. There is not yet one person, one
animal, bird, fish, crab, tree, rock, hollow, canyon, meadow, or forest. All alone the sky
exists. The face of the earth has not yet appeared. Alone lies the expanse of the sea, along
with the womb of all the sky. There is not yet anything gathered together. All is at rest.
Nothing stirs. All is languid, at rest in the sky. There is not yet anything standing erect.
Only the expanse of the water, only the tranquil sea lies alone. There is not yet anything
that might exist. All lies placid and silent in the darkness, in the night.

All alone are the Framer and the Shaper, Sovereign and Quetzal Serpent, They
Who Have Borne Children and They Who Have Begotten Sons. Luminous they are in
the water, wrapped in quetzal feathers and cotinga feathers. Thus they are called
Quetzal Serpent. In their essence, they are great sages, great possessors of knowledge.
Thus surely there is the sky. There is also Heart of Sky, which is said to be the name of
the god.

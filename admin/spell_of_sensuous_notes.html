  <div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold"> Reactions to "The Spell of the Sensuous" by David Abram</div>
  
</div></div>
<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>
  <div> The first chapter is interesting, and his own experiences are described vividly. On the conceptual side, it describes 
a tradition of western thought, coming from Christianity and the enlightenment, which posits that humans are the only earthly  repository of spirit, and that the
natural world outside the human is a vast soulless mechanism.  This tradition of thought justifies the
exploitation by humans of non-human nature. This tradition is not only incorrect in its judgements, but, as we are now seeing, is disastrous for our own prospects as humans. Also, sensitivity and appreciation of non-human nature is crucial to a good life. In these matters I am entirely in sympathy with Abram.
</div></div>


<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>
  <div>I read the next chapter (X) and skimmed the rest of the book. The chapter contains two parts, one on Husserl and one on Merleau-Ponty. I had reactions
to each part, which I will detail here.  
</div></div>

<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>
In part 1 Abram retold one aspect  of Husserl's work. This aspect I would call "phenomena without phenomenology".  What I mean by this is that Abram asked us to take phenomena (experience) seriously and not to identify the world with the world as scientificly understood, but did not say anything about phenomenology - the study of phenomena. The doctrine of the primacy of  phenomena is indeed a core part of Husserl's message: the view that we encounter our experience of things first, and much later learn of or construct scientific  theories. The latter are very different from the former. An encounter with a bird, rock, or the sky as we experience them  are not encounters with atoms or quantum fields! The scientific picture of the world is in this sense embedded in the world of phenomena.
Some people think that the embedding goes both ways: that the phenomenal
world is embedded in the world as scientifically understood. 
</div></div>


<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>
  The other major part of Husserl's work was phenomenogy. For this purpose, Husserl introduced such terms as
Epoche, Hyle, Horizon, Noema, and Noesis.  Abram does not touch on phenomenology, as opposed to the primacy of phenomena. Nonetheless he manages to spend
 dozens of pages on the matter. 
A paragraph or two would have sufficed, it seems to me.
</div></div>
<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>
In part 2, Abram turns to MP. I know Husserl's work much better than that of Merleau-Ponty, and was not entirely able to disentangle which views should be
attributed to Abram and which to MP.</div></div>
<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>
 The major themes of the part seemed to me to be 1) The activites of the mind are carried out in a physical body,
and this bodily aspect  deserves attention.
2) Perception is participatory: subjects of perception are not passive; perception is always an interaction between active perceiver and active percievded.  
</div></div>
<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>
 The first point I agree with. But although thought, perception, and so on arise in a body, and are affected by bodily events and properties,
they themselves are not bodies or parts of bodies<!--, just as an algorithm is not a circuit-->. Saying that everything arises in a body does not solve any problems.
One cannot explain a single activity of body or mind just by saying that it is carried out in a physical body. 
</div></div>
<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>
  The "all is embodied" mantra  leads to long poetic statements in tsos, statements which do not always provide illumination
  </div></div>
<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>
2) is only true when the thing experienced is either biological, or  something that is otherwise changed by us, such as  a chair, or a 
machine that responds to us. It is not true of the trees or rocks beside the road which we fail to  crash into, but which we nonetheless perceive,  or the distant mountains, or the sky. Also it is dubious
that a chair experiences, in any sense, us sitting in it. Of course we may imagine that things respond to us when they don't. We might pray to a stone idol, and imagine that
it responds. So the reciprocity of perception is part of our phenomenal world, but is sometimes illusory.
</div></div>

<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div> An his striving for a poetic take on the sensuous world Abram sometimes goes too far. Example from chapter 6 part 1: "The precise contour of the horizon varies considerably in different terrains, yet whenever we climb to a prominent vantage point, the circular character  of the visible world becomes explicit. Thus cyclical time, the experiential time of an oral culture, has the same shape as perceivable space. And the two circles are, in truth, one."  In truth one?  This is equivalent to saying, "time=space=jelly doughnut". I doubt that this  nonsensical thought has ever entered an indiginous mind.  <!-- One too many bong hits might induce it.-->

<!--
Abram has a way of making vacuous or repetive observations in verbose ways.
first point seems obvious to me, because I am a naturalist (
Language is rooted in actions of the body, exclamations, gestures, grunts and so forth.  
has built up inside the world of phenomena.
He retold basic Husserlian phenomenology, and that of Merleau-Ponty. He did not add much to 
Husserl's account. I'm not sure he illuminated anything  about exp erience of  the non-human world by this exercise. 
Phenomenology for him seemed mostly  a way to illustrate the fact
that the world is more than what is seen by modern science, and that well-respected philosophers have recognized that.  Doh!
No need to retell the story
of a philosophical traditon to make that point. It surely introduced many readers to phenomenology, which is a good thing. But one can also
read about phenomenology from the source material.
</div></div>

<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>In the above,  I am mostly thinking of the Husserl subchapter  (chapter 2 part 1). 
</div></div>
<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div> I know Husserl's work much better than that of Merleau-Ponty, with whose work I have only passing acquaintance.  But  Abram's chapters on language, for which Merleau-Ponty is presented as the primary oracle,  to my view, gives a very distorted picture of the role of language in human life. 
I don't know how much of this distortion was Abram's take on Merleau-Ponty  and how much came from Merleau-Ponty's own views. But  Abram's language chapters sought to present human linguistic communication as something we share with other species, namely ,as a gestural matter, not a matter of syntax and semantics. But human language allows us, through syntax and semantics, to communicate and think about the structure of the world, its categories, its laws, and to construct the shareable human worlds of myth and fiction. It makes us very different from other species (as far as we so far know).  Abram construes attention to  this aspect of human language as yet another plot to 
remove us from the sensual.  I think of it in the opposite way. Poetry and poetry alone can bring me closer to certain aspects of nature.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div> And there other things that are simply wrong, in my view. Quoth Abram " Our most  immediate experience of things, according to Merleau-Ponty, is necessarily an experience of a reciprocal encounter".
But this is only true when the thing experienced is either biological, or  something that is otherwise changed by us, such as  a chair, or a 
machine that responds to us. It is not true of the trees or rocks beside the road which we fail to  crash into, but which we nonetheless perceive,  or the distant mountains, or the sky. Also it is dubious
that a chair experiences, in any sense, us sitting in it. Of course we may imagine that things respond to us when they don't. We might pray to a stone idol, and imagine that
it responds. So the reciprocity of perception is part of our phenomenal world, but is sometimes illusory.</p>

<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div> Another complaint: in his striving for a poetic take on the sensuous world Abram often goes too far. Example from chapter 6 part 1: "The precise contour of the horizon varies considerably in different terrains, yet whenever we climb to a prominent vantage point, the circular character  of the visible world becomes explicit.

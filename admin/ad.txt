 pixels.com produces dozens of products
 displaying  images that I have created. 
 Any pattern that you can perceive is in a sense made of mathematics. If you note a symmetry, a repetition,
 anything systematic that knits the pattern together, then something mathematical is going on. You may not be familiar with the mathematics 
 which can deconstruct a given pattern, but in a sense your mind possesses this mathematical capability of deconstruction "under the hood".
 
I play with mathematical methods for constructing images, looking for what seems interesting or beautiful to me. 
 
My website, https://kingdomofpattern.com , includes animations as well as still images.   Technical information about my image generation code is also included.

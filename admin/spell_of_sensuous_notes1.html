  <div style="text-align:center;font-weight:bold"> Reactions to "The Spell of the Sensuous" by David Abram</div>
  
</div></div>
<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>
  <div> The first chapter is interesting, and his own experiences are described vividly. On the conceptual side, it describes 
a tradition of western thought, coming from Christianity and the enlightenment, which posits that humans are the only earthly  repository of spirit, and that the
natural world outside the human is a vast soulless mechanism.  This tradition of thought justifies the
exploitation by humans of non-human nature. This tradition is not only incorrect in its judgements, but, as we are now seeing, is disastrous for our own prospects as humans. Also, sensitivity and appreciation of non-human nature is crucial to a good life. In these matters I am entirely in sympathy with Abram.

<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>
  <div>I did not much like the rest of the book, which I skimmmed.  
He retold basic Husserlian phenomenology, and that of Merleau-Ponty. He did not add much to 
Husserl's account. I'm not sure he illuminated anything  about experience of  the non-human world by this exercise. 
Phenomenology for him seemed mostly  a way to illustrate the fact
that the world is more than what is seen by modern science, and that well-respected philosophers have recognized that.  Doh!
No need to retell the story
of a philosophical traditon to make that point. It surely introduced many readers to phenomenology, which is a good thing. But one can also
read about phenomenology from the source material.
</div></div>

<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div>In the above,  I am mostly thinking of the Husserl subchapter  (chapter 2 part 1). 
</div></div>
<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div> I know Husserl's work much better than that of Merleau-Ponty, with whose work I have only passing acquaintance.  But  Abram's chapters on language, for which Merleau-Ponty is presented as the primary oracle,  to my view, gives a very distorted picture of the role of language in human life. 
I don't know how much of this distortion was Abram's take on Merleau-Ponty  and how much came from Merleau-Ponty's own views. But  Abram's language chapters sought to present human linguistic communication as something we share with other species, namely ,as a gestural matter, not a matter of syntax and semantics. But human language allows us, through syntax and semantics, to communicate and think about the structure of the world, its categories, its laws, and to construct the shareable human worlds of myth and fiction. It makes us very different from other species (as far as we so far know).  Abram construes attention to  this aspect of human language as yet another plot to 
remove us from the sensual.  I think of it in the opposite way. Poetry and poetry alone can bring me closer to certain aspects of nature.</p>
</div></div>
<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div> And there other things that are simply wrong, in my view. Quoth Abram " Our most  immediate experience of things, according to Merleau-Ponty, is necessarily an experience of a reciprocal encounter".
But this is only true when the thing experienced is either biological, or  something that is otherwise changed by us, such as  a chair, or a 
machine that responds to us. It is not true of the trees or rocks beside the road which we fail to  crash into, but which we nonetheless perceive,  or the distant mountains, or the sky. Also it is dubious
that a chair experiences, in any sense, us sitting in it. Of course we may imagine that things respond to us when they don't. We might pray to a stone idol, and imagine that
it responds. So the reciprocity of perception is part of our phenomenal world, but is sometimes illusory.</p>

</div>
</div>

<div class="textGrid"> 
  <div></div> Another complaint: in his striving for a poetic take on the sensuous world Abram often goes too far. Example from chapter 6 part 1: "The precise contour of the horizon varies considerably in different terrains, yet whenever we climb to a prominent vantage point, the circular character  of the visible world becomes explicit. Thus cyclical time, the experiential time of an oral culture, has the same shape as perceivable space. And the two circles are, in truth, one."  In truth one?  This is equivalent to saying, "time=space=jelly doughnut". I doubt that this  nonsensical thought has ever entered an indiginous mind.  <!-- One too many bong hits might induce it.-->

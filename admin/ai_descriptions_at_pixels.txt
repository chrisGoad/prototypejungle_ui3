field lines 
Several white lines form a complex and hypnotic pattern against a black background. The composition features curves that seemingly create a sense of movement and depth, reminiscent of a topographical map or waves.

Ramp
A vibrant triangular grid fades into the distance against a pitch-black background, producing an illusion of depth. The colorful points are arranged in a perspective pattern that gives a three-dimensional feel to the two-dimensional surface.

Enigma
A three-dimensional geometric shape is rendered with a textured yellow appearance against a solid blue background. The design evokes a sense of depth and complexity with its intersecting planes and central void.

Cloth
A complex labyrinth fills the frame, with its intricate paths rendered in white on a black background. The maze-like structure offers a sense of intricate complexity and challenge, appearing almost impossible to solve.


Form
A symmetrical triangular shape with a hollow center dominates a black background, displaying an intricate pattern of lines that create a sense of depth and dimension. Subtle moir√© patterns accentuate the hypnotic three-dimensional effect within the triangle's borders, suggesting a path leading into the darkness in the center.

Partition 3
A complex network of intertwining lines in blue, red, and white creates a swirling pattern against a black background. Each strand twists and overlaps, contributing to the mesmerizing and chaotic structure that gives a sense of depth and motion.

Distortion Field
A curved grid pattern with red and white accents bends across a dark background, creating a sense of digital three-dimensionality. The repetitive nature of the grid and the smooth curvature give it a mathematical or computer-generated appearance.

Drop Circles
Numerous white dots form a complex spiral pattern on a black background, resembling a galaxy or spiral nebula. The depiction is reminiscent of celestial objects as seen in astronomical images, creating a sense of vast cosmic scale.

Light
Glowing light fades into the darkness, giving the impression of a tunnel or portal created by the gradient of small to large dots. The pattern suggests a radial symmetry which draws focus towards the center where the light is most intense.


Motion Illusion
A multitude of small, colored dots forms a gradient from purple at the edges to blue at the center, creating a hexagonal design. The dots appear to be organized in a concentric pattern, giving an optical illusion of depth and three-dimensionality.

Bloom
A myriad of overlapping circles in different shades of purple, white, and gray forms an intricate pattern. The composition resembles a circular, abstract mosaic with varying opacities and sizes of the circles creating a sense of depth and complexity.

Partition 4
Intersecting white lines create a series of geometric shapes against a dark background, giving a sense of intricate webbing and randomness. Within the geometric boundaries, dense clusters of white lines suggest a chaotic texture in contrast with the organized outer structure.

Blue
A geometric composition with a gradient of colors ranging from blues to purples forms an abstract pattern. The image is pixelated with an effect that gives the impression of a three-dimensional shape with a central vanishing point.

Field of Squares
A myriad of white outlined squares and rectangles of varying sizes are scattered across a solid red background, creating a dense, grid-like pattern. The composition gives a sense of digital pixelation or a stylized representation of a city map from an overhead perspective.

Thatch
A geometric pattern featuring a series of white dots and lines forming clusters that resemble flowers, set against a black background with intersecting textured strokes and solid blue squares creating a grid-like design. Each cluster of dots is arranged in a symmetrical pattern, contributing to the overall symmetry of the composition.

Cross 1
A series of black dots and lines converge to form a complex, symmetric pattern on a white background. The repetitive arrangement creates a visual illusion akin to a three-dimensional cube structure when viewed from certain angles.

Partition 1
A complex geometric pattern with multiple symmetrical shapes is portrayed in white lines against a black background. The design resembles a kaleidoscopic view with repeating elements that create a sense of depth and intricacy.

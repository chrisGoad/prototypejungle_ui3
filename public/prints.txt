If you'd like a print of any of the images at this site, there are two ways to go about it. First, you may download the image that interests you from this site. When you do this, download the high resolution version available via the "High Res" button on each image page. Then you can upload the jpg to mpix.com for printing (or any of the other sites that print jpgs). There are also online sites for printing onto cards, t-shirts, coffee cups, and so forth. If you take this route, I'd much appreciate it if you dropped me a line at cagoad@gmail.com with subject line "print" telling me which image(s) you printed.

I'll do the mpix work for you if you like. Just send an email with subject line "print please" to cagoad@gmail.com, telling me which image(s), at what size to print them, and what address to send them to (US only). I'll have mpix print on metal. My images look their best on metal - very crisp. I'll charge you what mpix charges me, plus %10. You can get funds to me by paypal or venmo (both to cagoad@gmail.com). A check  made out to "Christopher Goad" sent to PO Box 2766,Santa Fe,NM 87506 will also work.  I'll attempt to get the mpix work done within a few days of receiving funds. In my experience, Mpix prints usually arrive about a week after the print request. 

Below is a price list, with the 10% included.

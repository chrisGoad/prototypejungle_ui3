<p class="title">Quadtrees</p>
<p> A geometric <a style="color:white" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree">Quadtree</a> is a  data structure which consists of a hierarchical partition of quadrangles into smaller quadrangles.
 In the simplest case, the quadrangles are squares, as illustrated below.</p>

 <p>However, there are several other ways to partition a convex quadrangle into four smaller quadrangles. Here is one:</p>
  <p><img  src="https://kingdomofpattern.com/images/thumbs/quad_0_8_0.jpg" style="cursor:pointer"  width="400" height="400"/></p>
 <p>In this case, the partition is governed by five parameters. As illustrated, <span class="textVar">fr0</span> and fr1 govern an initial  partition of the big quadrangle into left and right quads. Then fr2 and fr3 govern a paritition of the left quad into parts, and similarly f4 and f5 govern the partition of the right. In each case frN is given by the fraction of the way along the relevant side that the end of the partitioning line is located. The sides are taken in clockwise order. The parameters for the above partition are {fr0:.4,fr1:.4,fr2:.4,fr3:.4,fr4:.6,fr5:.4} </p>
 <p> Here this partition is extended by two more levels, by partitioning the quads that appear at the first level according to the same rule, and then the second level quads again by the same rule:

<p> And here's the result of extending our partitions to six levels:</p>

<p> There are two other ways of partitioning a convex quadrangle into four parts. The first is analogous to the case we have just described, but with the initial partition applied horizontally rather than vertically. That is the first partition is into top and bottom rather than left and right. Here's a picture:</p>

<p>And finally, the partition can involve specifying a center point around which the partition is done, together with the distance along each side that the partitioning lines connect to:

<p> In the implementation, the partitioning method used for each quadrangle can be chosen programatically, so that the partitioning method varies at different parts of the hierarchy. An example appears below. In this case the partitioning rule varies from center-partition at odd levels, and a random choice between vertical-first and horizontal-first partitions at even. Also, there is randomness in the new center point chosen for center-partitions and in the partitioning parameters for vertical and horizontal partitions. There are eight levels.</p>

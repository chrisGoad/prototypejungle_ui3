<p class="title">Method Modules</p>
<p>A method module is something that adds a batch of methods to an image generator. Each supports the generation of a certain sort of image. For example grid.mjs enables the construction of visual grids, such as this one,</p> 
 <p><img  src="https://kingdomofpattern.com/thumbs/grid_droplets.jpg" alt="media" style="cursor:pointer"  width="300" height="300" /></p>

<p>and drop.mjs generates images by dropping elementary shapes onto the image at random, while avoiding collisions, as illustrated by this example. </p>

<p>Modules appear in the directory <span class="textVar">&lt;prototypejungle&gt;/mlib</span>.   Method modules can, and usually are, used together. They are described one by one in the following sections of this document.</p>

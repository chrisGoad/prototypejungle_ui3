<p class="title">Grids</p>

<p>The main image generator, <span class="textVar">generateGrid(params:Object)</span>,  calls the user defined JavaScript method <span class="textVar">shapeGenerator(gridCoordinates:Point,randomValues:Object)</span> on each grid cell. This  returns a shape. Its second, optional, argument is an object containing named random values which have been precomputed for the given grid point by the smooth bounded random value generator. This generator, given  <span class="textVar">max, min,</span> and  <span class="textVar">step</span> parameters for each named member of the <span class="textVar">randomValues</span> object, computes values for each grid point which differ from neighbors by no more than  <span class="textVar">step</span>, and which lie within the given <span class="textVar">min</span> and  <span class="textVar">max</span> values. Thus grid images can be generated populated by arbitrary shapes, whose attributes can be made to vary smoothly over the grid. </p>
<p> A second user defined method is <span class="textVar">boundaryLineGenerator(gridCoordinates:Point,randomValues:Object,end0:Point,end1:Point)</span>. This method returns a shape which represents one of the four boundaries of the cell, the one with the given end points. Thus the boundary lines as well as the occupants of grid cells can be depicted in the way that the coder sees fit.</p>

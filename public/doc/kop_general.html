<p class="title">General Considerations</p>
<p> The software which generated these images consists of a series of JavaScript modules, one for each type of image: <span class="textVar">drop, partition tree, grid, web,</span> and <span class="textVar">lines</span>. Each module exports a function that adds the relevant set of methods to a  JavaScript object. For each individual image, a "generator" loads the needed modules and applies their method-defining functions to an object which it creates, sets the parameters for that image, and finally, applies the top level image generation methods one or more times. </p>
<p> The software includes base capabilites, regardless of the image modules loaded.  These include methods for manipulating geometry and  "shapes". A shape is a JavaScript object which includes a link to an <a style="color:white" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a> representation used for its display.</p>

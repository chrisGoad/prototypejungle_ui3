<p> This <a href="../mlib/powerGrid.mjs">module</a> will be introduced, as usual, via annotated code, which generates the image</p>
 <p><img  src="https://kingdomofpattern.com/thumbs/grid_void.jpg?alt=media" style="cursor:pointer"  width="400" height="400"/></p>
 <p>First, here's a simplified variant of the  code, which generates</p>

<pre style="padding-left:20px;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold" class="code">
import {rs as rectPP} from '/shape/rectangle.mjs';
import {rs as basicsP} from '/generators/basics.mjs';
import {rs as addGridMethods} from '/mlib/grid.mjs';
import {rs as addRandomMethods} from '/mlib/boundedRandomGrids.mjs';

let wd = 100;
let nr = 32;

export {rs};
</pre>
<p> We've seen this all before except for the lines: </p>
<pre style="padding-left:20px;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold" class="code">
rs.powerParams  = {
  root:2,
  sizeMap:[0.5,0.5,1,1],
  fillMap:['red','yellow','blue','white']
};
</pre>
<p> <span class="textVar">rs.powerParams</span> describes a particular way of computing the size, fill, and stroke, to be assigned to the shape which will populate the given cell. There is a <span class="textVar">sizeMap</span> for sizes and a <span class="textVar">fillMap</span> and <span class="textVar">strokeMap</span> for colors (all of these maps are optional). These maps take as input the largest power of <span class="textVar">root</span> which occurs as factor in both of the cell's coordinates.  Call the largest power of <span class="textVar">root</span> which occurs as a factor of a number its root-regularity.  Then odd numbers have 2-regularity 0 because they are not multiples of any power of 2. Numbers of the form 2*&lt;odd-number&gt; have 2-regularity 1 because they have a factor which is 2**1. Numbers of the form 4*&lt;odd-number&gt; have 2-regularity 2 because they are multiples of 2**2. And so on. Here is a 2-regularity table for numbers up to 16:
<pre style="padding-left:20px;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold" class="code">
input         0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16
2-regularity  0  0  1  0  2  0  1  0  3  0   1  0  2  0  1  0  4
</pre>
<p>The 2-regularity of a cell is the minimum of the regularity of its x coordinate, and the regularity of its y coordinate. Perhaps now you can see how the image immediately above was generated. Regularity 0 cells are populated by small red rectangles. Regularity 1 cells are populated by small yellow rectangles. Regularity 2 cells are  populated by larger blue rectangles. Finally, regularity 3 cells are populated by  larger white rectangles.  </p>


<p> To generate the final image, we need to adjust <span class="textVar">widthFactor</span> and <span class="textVar">heightFactor</span> so that they go to zero near the center.</p>
 <p class="title"><img  src="https://kingdomofpattern.com/thumbs/grid_void.jpg?alt=media" style="cursor:pointer"  width="300" height="300"/></p>

<p>This is done by the following code:</p>

<pre style="padding-left:20px;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold" class="code">
rs.powerParamsByCell = function (cell) {
  let {numRows,numCols,powerParams} = this;
  let {x,y} = cell;
  let cx = numCols/2;
  let cy = numRows/2;
  // {x:cx,y:cy} are coordinates of center
  let maxd = Math.sqrt(cx*cx + cy*cy);
  let xdc = x - cx;
  let ydc = y - cy;
  let cd = Math.sqrt(xdc*xdc + ydc*ydc); // distance from center
  let df = cd/maxd; //fractional distance from center; 1 = far as possible; 0 = at center
  let yf = y/numRows;
  let wf =  1.3* df;
  powerParams.widthFactor = wf;
  powerParams.heightFactor = wf;
  return powerParams;
}
</pre>
<p> As a final, touch, a largish black square is added at the center by the following modified initializer: </p>
	<pre style="padding-left:20px;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold" class="code">
rs.initialize = function () {
  this.initProtos();
  this.addRectangle(this.backFill);
  this.generateGrid();
  let rdim = 10;
  this.addRectangle({width:rdim,height:rdim,fill:'black'});
  this.addFrame();
}
	</pre>

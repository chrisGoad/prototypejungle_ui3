<p class="title">Disclaimer</p>
<p> This documentation does not cover every single feature of PrototypeJungle. However, the main features and underlying techonology are described. In the dozens of 
<a href="../images.html">examples</a> included with this software, you will see some use of modules and methods that are missing from the documentation. But all of the source code is included in the distribution.</p>
<p> The documentation is provided for two reasons. The first and primary reason is to make the process by which the <a href="../images.html">included images</a> were generated comprehensible. The second is to enable others to generate images in the same way.</p>

<p class="title">Prototype Trees</p>

<p>In current practice, the prototype mechanism in JavaScript only supports the instantiation of components at a single level. If <span class="textVar">x</span> is a component which we wish to instantiate via prototypical inheritance, our first option is to invoke 
<span class="textVar">y=<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create">Object.create</a>(x)</span>. The newly created object <span class="textVar">y</span> only inherits from its prototype, <span class="textVar">x</span>, at the top level. All other structure is shared. So, if <span class="textVar">x</span> has any depth of structure, we have created something that is radically entangled with its prototype, and in this sense does not fulfill the purpose of instantiation: creation of a new copy of the component which inherits its functionality, but can be altered freely to suit its role. The second prototype-spawning option, <span class="textVar"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new">new</a></span>, has the same problem - it only operates at a single level.</p>
<p>By a "prototype tree" I mean a structure that is a tree from the standpoint of the  
<a  href="https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-own-properties/">object-to-own-property-value</a> relation, but in which 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain">prototype chains</a> and functions may appear. Here is an example of such a structure:</p>
 <img id="diagram" src="prototypeDiagram1_withText.svg" style="cursor:pointer"  width="550" height="250"/>

<p><span class="textVar">instantiate</span> is the core method of this structure. For a prototype tree <span class="textVar">y</span>, </p>

<pre style="padding-left:20px;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold" class="code">
let x = y.instantiate();
</pre>

<p>has an effect similar to </p>

<pre style="padding-left:20px;font-size:10pt;font-weight:bold" class="code">
let x =Object.create(y);
</pre>

<p>In both cases <span class="textVar">x</span> is a new object that inherits, prototype-style, from <span class="textVar">y</span>.  The difference is that while <span class="textVar">Object.create</span> operates at only one level, <span class="textVar">y.instantiate()</span> does a deep copy of <span class="textVar">y</span> as a tree, and returns a structure in which all of the copied nodes inherit prototype-wise from the nodes from which they were copied, and in which the prototype chains of <span class="textVar">y</span> have also been copied into <span class="textVar">x</span>.

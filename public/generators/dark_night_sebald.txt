When, in the summer of last year,
I visited the engineer D. in Zurich
he was sitting by an open window
and kept turning a piece of feldspar
around in his hands. You see,
he said, outside, the garden grows rank,
my place is in the midst of the foliage.
That reminds me of the migration
through the desert. How many machines
I'd built, how many works designed,
before I lost my belief
in the science I'd always served.
I had arrived at one of the dead
bays of time, like that Tatar
with the red headcloth and the white
curved feather, had climbed the mountain
and surveyed the city, as it lay
before me, a faded picture
of the great diluvium.
I sensed the trembling
of the aerials on the roofs
of houses as a frizzle
in my brain, could hear from far away
outside me
the Gaussian roar, an unremitting
sound extending over the whole scale
from the earth up to the heavens
where the stars drift
in the aether. Many
terrible midnights
of doubt have I passed
since that time, but now peace
returns to the dust and I read
in the descriptions of nature
of the eighteenth century how a
verdant land is submerged
in the blue shadows of the Jurassus
and in the end  only the age-old
ice on the Alps retains a faint
afterglow. A strange light pervades
the lines of Haller and  Hölderlin
and yet even here there is vagary
as far as the heart reaches. For
the revolutions of great
systems cannot be
righted, too diffuse are
the workings of power
the one thing always
the other's beginning
and vice versa. Taurus
draconem genuit et draco
taurum, and nowhere
a stop. So you'd better be off,
said the engineer D., this very day.
The country's on fire already and everywhere
the forests are ablaze, there's crackling
of fire in the fanned leaves
and the drought African
plains are expanding. Still
perhaps on your travels
you'll see a golden coast
a land veneered with rain or
a schoolboy on his way home
over a beautiful meadow. Then
another joy will have been lived,
thinks one who recovers a little.
The shady shore of a lake
emerges, the water's surface
the ribbons of rocks and
on the highest summit the dragon's
many-colored plumage, Icarus,
sailing in the midst of
currents of light. Beneath him
time divides the Rhine glacier
into two mighty branches,
the Churfirsten peaks emerge,
the Säntis range rises,
chalk islets, glowing
bright in drifting ice.
If his eyes are now
lowered, if he falls
down into the lake,
will then, as in Brueghel's
picture, the beautiful ship,
the ploughing peasant, the whole
of nature somehow turn away
from the son's misfortune?
These questions carry me
over the border. On the Arlberg
a thunderstorm gathers.
I gaze down into the valley
and my soul is sent reeling.
Another summer gone by and
as ivy hangs down,Hölderlin wrote,
so does branchless the rain. Moss roses
grow on the Alps. Avignon sylvan.
Across the Gotthard a horse gropes its way.
